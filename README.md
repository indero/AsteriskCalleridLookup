Asterisk Callerid Lookup
========================

The goal is to provide a callerid lookup for non distribution installation of asterisk.

In the Future this will work with the Asterisk AGI.
At the moment you can call the cdlkp.rb on your shell with the phonenumber as an argument, and it will return the name
on stdout.

You can rename the numbers.csv.sample to numbers.csv and add your own numbers.
